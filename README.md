# Toradex oe-core Setup

To simplify installation we provide a manifest for the repo tool which manages
the different git repositories and the used versions.
[more on repo](https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/)

This manifest allows setting up TorizonCore or Toradex Reference Images.

For our internal use it also allows to setup OE for the Toradex Easy Installer and
our internal Tester.
